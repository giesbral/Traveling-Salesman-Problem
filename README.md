# Traveling-Salesman-Problem
A 2-Opt solution to the traveling salesman problem, written in C++

"Program 4 - 2-OPT" was written in C++ and uses a makefile to compile in a Linux environment. The source code and makefile have been provided in a zipped folder.

To run "Program 4 - 2-OPT" please perform the following steps:

1) Copy and unzip the folder containing the makefile and source code in flip.

2) If you're not already there, navigate to the folder to where you unzipped the file and type "make" into the command line. This will use the instructions in the makefile to compile the program.

	a. While compiling, make may print a few warnings about comparing size_t and integers or using a variable before it is assigned. These are general warnings and can safely be ignored in this case, and they will not prevent the program from compiling.

3) Make will create an executable called "2OPT", type "2OPT <input file>" with your input file name into the command line to run the program.

4) The program will print to the screen the run time results of the algorithm.

5) When the program is done processing the input data, it will write the resulting tour length and vertex order to a file named <input file>.tour

6) Press any key to close the program.

Thanks very much!
